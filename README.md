## Description:
HelpRealm is a lightweight support system for your customers. Customers can create support requests 
specifying text content and attachments. For each support request there is a ticket created which is then handled 
by a registered agent. Tickets can be routed into different groups where initial tickets are routed to a defined 
index group. Superadmins can manage agents and groups. Customers and agents get notified about ticket updates by e-mail.
The support system is especially suitable for freelancers and small teams.
